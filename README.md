# Stroke Predictor Kaggle Dataset

# Description
With all the tools we have created with Machine Learning is that we are able to find paterns and create predictions for them with relative success. The thing that will bring us futher into our already increasingly sci-fi world is going to be the use of machine learning to predict health issues. We can already see it happening with many insurance companies giving discounts to members using wearable technology. This EDA and simple SVC and SGD Classifier shows how relatively easy it is to predict a stroke. Think of the things we can do if we can identify parterns for things like cancer, brain aneurysms, and more. 

## Some Graphs
The most interesting graphs that I found while doing this EDA was that Stroke patients exhibited the same general trends as people who had not had strokes. Making it that much harder to predict

This graph shows the BMI curve for all patients and the darker blue shows stroke patients who, for the most part, aren't far from the distribution of BMI for people of their age groups
